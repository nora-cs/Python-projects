# 1. write a python function to find the max of 3 numbers.

#So for example if func(23, 25, 25)
#it should print 23, 25, and 25,
#if func(20, 21)
#it should print 20, 21
+#Also, it must return both addition and subtraction in a single return call.
#Write a program to create a function show_employee() using the following conditions.
#It should accept the employeeâ€™s name and salary and display both.
#If the salary is missing in the function call then assign default value 9000 to salary

#January 12th
#Write a shut_down functioon that takes one argument. if the argument is yes, the function should return shutting down, if no it should return shut down aborted. if the argument is neither yes or no, the function should return sorry.

  else:
        print('sorry')
  shut_down()      
#Define a function called hotel_cost with one argument nights as input. The hotel costs $140 per night. So, the function hotel_cost should return 140 * nights.
#Define a function called plane_ride_cost that takes a string, city, as input. The function should return a different price depending on the location.
#define a function called rental_car_cost with an argument called days. Calculate the cost of renting the car: Every day you rent the car costs $40.(cost=40*days) if you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total(cost-=50). Alternatively (elif), if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total. You cannot get both of the above discounts. Return that cost.
#Now define a function called trip cost that takes the output from the three functions above and prints the total cost of the trip
#First, def a function called distance_from_zero, with one argument (choose any argument name you like). If the type of the argument is either int or float, the function should return the absolute value of the function input. Otherwise, the function should return "Nope". Check if it works calling the function with -5.6 and "what?".

#What are the two values of a boolean data type. How do you write them. 
True = 1, False = 0
#What are the three boolean operators? 
and, or , not
#Write out the truth tables of both boolean operators i.e every possible combination of boolean values and their result. 
and	True if both are true	a and b
or	True if at least one is true	a or b
not	True only if false
#What are the six comparison operators. 
Less than(<), Greater that(>), Less than or equal to(<=), Greater than or equal to (>=), Equal to(==), Not equal to(!=)
#What is the difference between the equal operator and the assignment operator
the equal operator(=)is used to assign value to a variable and the assignment operator (==)is used to compare two variable or constants
